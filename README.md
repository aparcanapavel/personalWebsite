## Overview ##
In the Rutgers DCIM Capstone class, we were asked to make a portfoilo page with certain requirements showcasing all the projects we have made in the DCIM Minor. Although we were allowed to use template sites like Wordpress and Wix, I wanted to push my HTML, CSS and jQuery knowledge at the time. The first version of the project met the requirements for the class and much more. Later, I continued to learn other technologies that helped me achieve the current version.


### Development server

- Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 
- The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

- Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. 
- You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

- Run `ng build` to build the project. 
- The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
- Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
