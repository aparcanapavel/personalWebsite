          "blogParagraph": "ello and welcome to the blog portion of my website! My professional journey began a little over a year ago, when I took a web design class at Rutgers University. In this class, we were taught the basic principles of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a little jQuery, and no JavaScript. Since, I have been using free online tools to learn new skills and take my current ones a step further. For example, I have been learning JavaScript, TypeScript, the Angular 7 framework, and Bootstrap for Angular. The reason for this is because of my web design professor stating to the class how important it is to learn JavaScript. With HTML and CSS, one is able to design interactive pages, however, with JavaScript, one is able to add much more to the interactivity between pages."

          "blogParagraph": "As I was learning JavaScript, I found out more about jQuery, thus allowing me to add more interactivity to my web design projects. I then challenged myself to create a personal website for one of my final classes at Rutgers. The final product then encouraged me to continue learning more, as I wanted to accomplish more in my pages, and I wanted more interactivity. As I continued to learn jQuery and JavaScript, I became exposed to the term “Angular”."

          "blogParagraph": "Learning Angular was a bit of a challenge at first, since it is a big framework, but the more I continue to work with it, the easier it has been getting. This also applied to TypeScript, since It is very similar to JavaScript. Learning these tools allowed me to officially take my projects to the next level. I am now able to have congruent websites with transitions and animations that make the web pages highly interactive. Looking back to about a year ago I can see that I have improved tremendously, but my journey definitively does not end here because there is so much more to learn. Here, in this blog section, I will be talking about current projects I am working on as well as future plans for my projects. Now that I have officially added a blog portion to my website, I am certain that I will be able look back and see my progress on becoming a full stack developer."

This then allowed me to understand how important writing a well-structured code meant. This is something I am not only seeing in this website, but every time I update my personal website, I see the previous code and think how I can make it much shorter, for it to run faster and smoother."
